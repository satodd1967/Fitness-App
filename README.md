# TrailFinder

The fitness app is the first iteration of what hopefully will become a larger app called the Humiliatin Challenge App.  My coworkers and I about 5 years ago started a fitness challenge called the Humiliation Challenge.  This was a fitness challenge focused on basic healthy habbits.  To participate a contestant needed to utilize a fitness tracking watch (apple watch, garmin, fitbit etc.) and utilize the My Fitness Pal application to track thier food and activity via the smart device.  They also needed to have a withins, scale, fitbit scale, or some similar device to track thier weight and bodyfat.  Each day your weight, bodyfat, activity and food diary got tracked via My Fitness Pal.  That information was then shared with all contestants that were participating.  The data was converted into points and the person with the most points at the end of the contest won.  This was a hugely successful challenge.  This fitness app is the first iteration building toward that functionality and will eventually pull its data direclty from the My Fitness Pal API.

In its current iteration this app allows a user to create an account and manually enter thier starting information, goals and then track thier inforamtion manualy via the app.  There currently isn't functionality to show points or track the contest over a specific period of time.
